# Neuralnets

This is my sandbox for learning AI. I will mostly reimplement examples from Andrew Kaparthy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) lecture series here. If you want to learn more, read my [blog post](https://blog.jan-berndt.de/posts/jangrad) on the topic.

**Check out the [jangrad/jangrad.ipynb](jangrad/jangrad.ipynb) notebook for an awesome demo!**
